Instructions to operate arduino board as trigger:

1. cd ~/beep
2. ino clean
3. ino build
4. sudo ino upload (enter password when prompted) 
5. sudo arduino&
6. In the interface that opens, click on the "Serial Monitor" button in the same top row as the check mark and the arrow pointing right
7. Leave everything open. Then cd ~/usbreader_database
8.  sudo ./trigger_init.sh
9. ./trigger.sh (this step is unnecessary if you wish to run DAQ; only for manual verification)
