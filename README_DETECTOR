- print 0
Control the verbosity (1 for debug)

- window 1e-6
coincidence window. Intrinsic minimum is ~ 1.e-7

- n_coincidences 4
This is the number of boards that have to be in coincidence for an event to be selected

- n_layers_per_event 15
This is the number of layers that have to be on for an event to be selected

- n_layers_per_board 3
Number of layers that have to be on for a board to be selected

- timeout 1000
After this time (ms) a board aborts initializing if no signal is received

- emit_trigger 0
Emit trigger pulse

- n_coincidence_events_per_root_file 20
This is the number of entries written to each root file by "convert_data_to_root.C"
